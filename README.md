Shibatch Sample Rate Converter (SSRC) is a fast and high-quality sample rate converter for PCM WAV files. It is designed to efficiently handle the conversion between commonly used sampling rates such as 44.1kHz and 48kHz while ensuring minimal sound quality degradation.

## Features

- **High-Quality Conversion**: Achieves excellent audio quality with minimal artifacts.
- **FFT-Based Algorithm**: Utilizes a unique [FFT-based algorithm](ALGORITHM.md) for precise and efficient sample rate conversion.
- **SleefDFT Integration**: Leverages [SleefDFT](https://sleef.org/dft.xhtml), a product of the [SLEEF Project](https://sleef.org/), for fast Fourier transforms (FFT), enabling high-speed conversions.
- **SIMD Optimization**: Takes advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) techniques for accelerated processing. It is capable of high-speed conversion using [AVX-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512).
- **Dithering Functionality**: Supports various dithering techniques, including noise shaping based on the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) curve.
- **Specialized Filters**: Implements high-order filters to address the challenges of converting between 44.1kHz and 48kHz.
- **Selectable Conversion Profile**: You can select the filter lengths and computing precision. Single-precision computation is generally sufficient for audio processing, and even the standard profile allows for highly accurate conversion. However, since this tool is designed for audiophiles, you can also select a profile that performs all computation in double precision.
- **Low-Latency Real-Time Processing**: Suitable for demanding real-time applications by combining minimum-phase filters with an efficient partitioned convolution algorithm.


## Why SSRC?

Sampling rates of 44.1kHz (used in CDs) and 48kHz (used in DVDs) are widely used, but their conversion ratio (147:160) requires highly sophisticated algorithms to maintain quality. SSRC addresses this challenge by using an FFT-based approach, coupled with SleefDFT and SIMD optimization, to achieve a balance between speed and audio fidelity.

See [here](https://shibatch.org/ssrc) for some experimental results.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: SSRC is compatible with multiple platforms.
- **Audio Files**: Input files should be in PCM WAV format.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shibatch/ssrc/).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Ensure the `ssrc` executable is accessible from your command line.

### Usage

The basic command structure is as follows:

```bash
ssrc [options] <source_file.wav> <destination_file.wav>
```

You can also use standard input and output:

```bash
cat input.wav | ssrc --stdin [options] --stdout > output.wav
```

#### Options

##### Example

Convert a WAV file from 44.1kHz to 48kHz with dithering:

```bash
ssrc --rate 48000 --dither 0 input.wav output.wav
```

#### Conversion Profiles

Profiles allow you to balance between conversion speed and quality (stop-band attenuation and filter length).

| Profile Name | FFT Length | Attenuation | Precision | Use Case                               |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `insane`     | 262144     | 200 dB      | double    | Highest possible quality, very slow.   |
| `high`       | 65536      | 170 dB      | double    | Excellent quality for audiophiles.     |
| `long`       | 32768      | 145 dB      | double    | Superb quality.                        |
| `standard`   | 16384      | 145 dB      | single    | Great quality, default setting.        |
| `short`      | 4096       | 96 dB       | single    | Good quality.                          |
| `fast`       | 1024       | 96 dB       | single    | Good quality, suitable for most uses.  |
| `lightning`  | 256        | 96 dB       | single    | Low latency, suitable for real-time uses. |

You can see all profiles and their technical details by running `ssrc --profile help`.


#### Channel Mixing (`--mixChannels`)

The `--mixChannels` option allows you to mix, re-route, or change the number of channels using a matrix string.

- **Syntax**: The matrix string is a series of numbers separated by commas (`,`) and semicolons (`;`).
  - Commas (`,`) separate the gain values for each column in a row.
  - Semicolons (`;`) separate the rows.
- **Logic**:
  - The number of rows in the matrix defines the number of output channels.
  - The number of columns in the matrix must match the number of input channels.

##### Example 1: Stereo to Mono Downmix
To combine a 2-channel stereo input into a 1-channel mono output, you can use a 1-row, 2-column matrix. The standard formula is `Mono = 0.5 * Left + 0.5 * Right`.
```bash
--mixChannels '0.5,0.5'
```

##### Example 2: Mono to Stereo
To duplicate a 1-channel mono input into a 2-channel stereo output, you can use a 2-row, 1-column matrix.
```bash
--mixChannels '1;1'
```
This sets both the left and right output channels to be equal to the mono input channel.

##### Example 3: Swapping Stereo Channels
To swap the left and right channels of a stereo file, you need a 2x2 matrix. The goal is to make the new left channel equal to the old right channel, and the new right channel equal to the old left channel.
```bash
--mixChannels '0,1;1,0'
```
- The first row `0,1` means `Output0 = (0 * Input0) + (1 * Input1)`.
- The second row `1,0` means `Output1 = (1 * Input0) + (0 * Input1)`.


## Spectrum Analyzer (`scsa`)

The project includes `scsa`, a command-line spectrum analyzer. While it can be used as a general-purpose analyzer, it is primarily designed for automated testing and verification, for example in a CI environment.

#### Purpose and Features

- **Automated Testing**: The primary purpose of `scsa` is to check audio spectra against predefined criteria, making it ideal for automated quality assurance in a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Cross-Platform and Dependency-Free**: As a command-line tool, it does not rely on any GUI libraries or have OS-specific dependencies, making it highly portable and easy to integrate into various workflows.
- **SVG Output for Debugging**: When a test fails, `scsa` can generate an SVG image of the spectrum. This visual output is extremely useful for identifying the cause of the failure. An SVG is also generated if no check file is provided, allowing `scsa` to be used as a general-purpose analyzer.
- **High-Precision Analysis**: Unlike many standard analyzers, all internal processing is performed in double precision. This minimizes the impact of floating-point noise, allowing for highly accurate measurements.
- **High-Resolution Windowing**: It uses a 7-term Blackman-Harris window function, which provides excellent dynamic range and frequency resolution, enabling very sharp and precise spectrum analysis.

#### Usage

```bash
scsa [<options>] <source file name> <first position> <last position> <interval>
```

#### Options

| Option                     | Description                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--log2dftlen <log2dftlen>`| Set the log2 of the DFT length. Default: 12.                                                   |
| `--check <check file>`     | Specify a file containing spectrum check criteria.                                             |
| `--svgout <svg file name>` | Specify the output SVG file name for the spectrum graph.                                       |
| `--debug`                  | Print detailed debugging information during processing.                                        |

#### Check File Format

The check file is a plain text file that defines the spectral criteria for the `scsa` tool. Each line in the file specifies a single constraint.

- **Format**: Each constraint is defined on a new line with the following format:
  `<low_freq> <high_freq> <comparison> <threshold_db>`
  - `<low_freq>`: The lower bound of the frequency range in Hz (double).
  - `<high_freq>`: The upper bound of the frequency range in Hz (double).
  - `<comparison>`: The comparison operator. Can be one of `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), or `^` (peak).
  - `<threshold_db>`: The threshold value in decibels (double).

- **Comments**: Lines starting with a `#` character are treated as comments and are ignored. Empty lines are also ignored.

- **Logic**: The check logic depends on the comparison operator:
  - **`<`**: Checks if **all** frequency components in the range are **less than** the threshold.
  - **`>`**: Checks if **all** frequency components in the range are **greater than** the threshold.
  - **`^`**: Checks if the **peak** frequency component in the range is **greater than or equal to** the threshold.

- **Example**:
  ```
  # This is a comment
  # Check for stop-band attenuation
  1 9900 < -140

  # Check for pass-band flatness (hypothetical)
  # 20 20000 > -1
  ```
  In this example, the tool will check if the spectrum is below -140 dB in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 9900 Hz. The second rule is commented out, so it will be ignored.

## For Developers (Library Usage)

In addition to the command-line tool, SSRC provides powerful C++ and C APIs, allowing you to integrate the resampling engine directly into your own projects. It can be built as a static or shared library for native applications on Windows (without requiring MSYS/Cygwin), Linux, and other platforms.

For detailed information on the API, please see [**API_DOCUMENTATION.md**](API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### C++ API (`ssrc.hpp`)
A modern, C++17 API that uses templates and standard library features for flexible and type-safe audio processing pipelines.

### C API (`ssrcsoxr.h`)
A C-language API that is compatible with the popular SoX Resampler library (`libsoxr`). By defining `SSRC_LIBSOXR_EMULATION`, SSRC can serve as a drop-in replacement for `soxr` in existing projects.

#### Building a Sustainable Future for Our Open Source Projects

We believe that Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is a wonderful
ecosystem that allows anyone to use software freely. However, to
maintain and enhance its value over the long term, continuous
maintenance and improvement are essential.

Like many FOSS projects, we face the challenge that long-term
sustainability is difficult to achieve through the goodwill and
efforts of developers alone. While the outputs of open-source projects
are incorporated into the products of many companies and their value
is rightfully recognized, the developers who create these outputs are
not always treated as equal partners in the business world.

A license guarantees the "freedom to use," but the spirit of the FOSS
ecosystem is based on a culture of mutual respect and contribution
built upon that freedom. We believe that accepting the "value" of a
project's output while unilaterally refusing dialogue with its
creators simply because they are individuals undermines the
sustainability of this ecosystem. Such companies should not turn a
blind eye to the reality that someone must bear the costs to make the
cycle sustainable.

This issue is not just about corporations; it reflects a deeper
cultural expectation within the FOSS ecosystem itself. Over time, we
have come to take for granted that everything in open source should be
provided for free - not only the code, but also the ongoing effort to
maintain and improve it. However, FOSS licenses guarantee the freedom
to use and modify software; **they do not impose an obligation on
developers to offer perpetual, unpaid maintenance**. When this
distinction is overlooked, maintainers can end up burdened with work
that was never meant to be an open-ended personal commitment. Such an
imbalance not only discourages openness, but also undermines the
sustainability of an ecosystem that has become a vital part of modern
society.

To explain the phenomenon occurring across the entire ecosystem:
Developers write code they find useful and release it as FOSS. It
gains popularity, and soon large corporations incorporate it into
their products, reaping substantial profits. Requests for new features
and fixes flood in, yet no financial support accompanies
them. Eventually, the maintainer realizes there is no personal or
professional benefit in responding to these unpaid demands. The skills
required to develop popular FOSS are often in high demand in other
fields as well. Ultimately, the maintainer burns out and the project
is abandoned. This is the unsustainable cycle we are tackling.

Within this unsustainable cycle, adopting FOSS into products while
fully aware of this situation is hardly beneficial for either
companies or the society at large. To make the cycle sustainable,
everyone must recognize the reality that someone must bear the costs,
and these costs are equivalent to what companies would need to develop
and maintain comparable products. This project specifically requests
companies profiting from our deliverables to contribute to maintaining
the project.

To be clear, this is not a request for charity; it is a proposal to
manage the operational risk. This is a systemic challenge originating
not from the developers, but from within the organizations that
consume and whose business continuity depends on FOSS. When a project
is abandoned due to this unresolved issue, the primary victims are not
the developers-who move on to other opportunities-but the companies
who built their products on an unmaintained foundation.

#### Our Request for Support

We request ongoing financial support from organizations that
incorporate our project's deliverables into their products or services
and derive **annual revenue exceeding US $1 million** from those
products and services, to help cover the costs of maintenance and the
development of new features. While this support is not a legal
obligation, let us be clear: the license is a grant of permission to
use our work, not a service contract obligating us to provide
perpetual, unpaid labor. We consider it a fundamental business
principle that to profit from a critical dependency while contributing
nothing to its stability is an extractive and unsustainable practice.

It is also crucial to recognize what "maintenance" truly entails. In a
living software project, it is not merely about preserving the status
quo of the current version. It is the continuous effort that leads to
security patches, compatibility with new environments, and the very
features that define future versions. Therefore, to claim satisfaction
with an older version as a reason to decline support, while
simultaneously benefiting from the ongoing development that produces
newer, better versions, is a logically inconsistent position.

This support is not intended to fund work for any single company, but
to sustain the project as a shared infrastructure that benefits **all
users and the broader community**. Furthermore, this threshold is
designed so that **individual developers, small-scale projects, and
the majority of our users are not asked to pay**, while seeking
appropriate support from companies that derive significant value from
our project.

We understand that corporate procurement processes were not designed
with FOSS sustainability in mind. We are committed to finding a
practical path forward, but your partnership is essential in
structuring a financial relationship that aligns with your standard
corporate procedures. Our mutual goal is to treat this partnership as
a conventional operational expense, removing your internal barriers
and making sustainability a straightforward business practice.

Our goal is to maintain this project stably over the long term and
make it even more valuable for all users. In an industry where many
projects are forced to abandon FOSS licenses, our preference is to
continue offering this project under a true open-source
license. However, the long-term viability of this FOSS-first approach
depends directly on the willingness of our commercial beneficiaries to
invest in the ecosystem they rely on. We hope our collaborative
approach can contribute to shaping a more balanced and enduring future
for FOSS.

Conduct](https://github.com/shibatch/nofreelunch?tab=coc-ov-file) or
