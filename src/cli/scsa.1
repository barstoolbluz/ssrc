.SH NAME
scsa \- command-line spectrum analyzer for automated testing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scsa
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<source file name>\fR \fI<first position>\fR \fI<last position>\fR \fI<interval>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scsa
is a command-line spectrum analyzer. While it can be used as a general-purpose analyzer, it is primarily designed for automated testing and verification, for example in a CI environment.
.P
Its main purpose is to check audio spectra against predefined criteria, making it ideal for automated quality assurance in a CI/CD pipeline. It is cross-platform and dependency-free. When a test fails,
.B scsa
can generate an SVG image of the spectrum for debugging.
.P
Unlike many standard analyzers, all internal processing is performed in double precision. This minimizes the impact of floating-point noise, allowing for highly accurate measurements. It also uses a 7-term Blackman-Harris window function, which provides excellent dynamic range and frequency resolution.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--log2dftlen <log2dftlen>\fR
Set the log2 of the DFT length. Default: 12.
.TP
\fB--check <check file>\fR
Specify a file containing spectrum check criteria.
.TP
\fB--svgout <svg file name>\fR
Specify the output SVG file name for the spectrum graph. An SVG is generated if a check file is provided and the test fails, or if no check file is provided at all.
.TP
\fB--debug\fR
Print detailed debugging information during processing.
.SH "CHECK FILE FORMAT"
The check file is a plain text file that defines the spectral criteria. Each line specifies a single constraint.
.P
.B Format:
<low_freq> <high_freq> <comparison> <threshold_db>
.IP
.B <low_freq>
The lower bound of the frequency range in Hz.
.IP
.B <high_freq>
The upper bound of the frequency range in Hz.
.IP
.B <comparison>
The comparison operator, either \fB<\fR (less than) or \fB>\fR (greater than).
.IP
.B <threshold_db>
The threshold value in decibels.
.P
Lines starting with a # character are treated as comments. For a check to pass, all frequency components within the range must satisfy the condition.
